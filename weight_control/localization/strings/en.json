  "normal_weight_text_1": "According to the World Health Organization, this is a normal weight-to-height ratio. In this range, your body will feel comfortable, and the likelihood of any disease will approach zero. It is important to remember that first of all you need to focus on your feelings and reflection in the mirror. The main thing is not to go beyond the proposed range and eat according to your plan, otherwise your well-being may deteriorate.",
  "index_text_1": "The Quetelet index (aka body mass index) is a value that allows you to assess the ratio of body weight to its height. The Quetelet index is used as the main tool for determining the state of body weight, which can be normal, excessive or insufficient.",
  "index_text_2": "Muscle is heavier than fat, so even with the same weight, two people can have completely different body quality. The lower the percentage of body fat and the higher the percentage of muscle, the more prominent the body. The athletic body is not the pounds on the scales, but the reflection in the mirror.",
  "index_text_3": "This method is not suitable for athletes with hypertrophied muscles and for pregnant women, but for most people, the Quetelet index fairly accurately reflects the presence or absence of excess fat mass.",
  "calories_text_1": "Caloric energy balance is extremely important for the body. Thanks to it, a person can not only reconstruct his body, but also competently approach questions about losing weight or gaining mass.",
  "calories_text_2": "The calorie norm for each person is different, and it is calculated taking into account age, height and weight. Also, do not forget about being active. Walking, going to the gym, or doing a simple warm-up at home significantly affects your calorie consumption per day.",
  "calories_text_3": "1. Thanks to a well-calculated energy balance, you can maintain your body in the shape you need. You will not lose weight or gain weight.\n\n2. If you stick to a properly calculated calorie deficit, it helps you and your body to get rid of excess subcutaneous fat without harm to health.\n\n3. With a precisely set calorie rate, you can also gain muscle mass. At the same time, reducing the proportion of fat, and not increasing it.",
  "calories_text_4": "The fact is that even if you are in a calorie deficit (it would seem that you eat less than the norm), the difference between your optimal calorie intake and the deficit one is minimal (about 50-100 calories).\n\nThus, the body receives all the necessary micro- and macronutrients. When the balance is in place, you do not experience the stress of eating restrictions.",
  "calories_text_5": "The calorie rate is an indicator that determines the very edge when you overeat.\n\nFor example, your rate for weight loss is 1500 kcal. If you eat a 500 kcal burger and during the day eat salad, meat, eggs and candy for another 1000 kcal, then you will not gain weight, but, on the contrary, will lose weight.\n\nDo not forget that you should not neglect a balanced diet. Vegetables and fruits contain a lot of vitamins and minerals for the healthy functioning of your body.\n\nA complete rejection of \"healthy\" foods leads to the emergence of a risk of diseases of the liver, kidneys and other organs that need regular intake of nutrients.",
  "protein_text_1": "Protein is an essential nutrient. Proteins take part in many important functions in the body, and with the help of them muscles are built, and the body will acquire a relief.\n\nMany athletes and bodybuilders use protein shakes when the daily protein intake is not sufficient. They have a maximum protein content per 100 ml (10 g).",
  "protein_text_2": "1. Participate in metabolism and help break down\n\n2. Increase the protective function of the body (immunity), prevent the appearance of viruses and various diseases\n\n3. Provide muscle contraction\n\n4. Serve as a building material for body cells and tissues\n\n5. Responsible for gaining mass. Protein is the most important component for a quality muscle set",
  "protein_text_3": "1. Loss of muscle mass, skin laxity and decreased body tone\n\n2. Decreased performance\n\n3. The appearance of excess weight\n\n4. Changes in the structure of the liver, and at the same time its functions will slow down\n\n5. Deterioration of the cardiovascular system\n\n6. Imbalance of hormones\n\n7. Decreased immunity, increased incidence",
  "protein_text_4": "Protein is not only a building material, but also a serious barrier between viruses and your healthy body. Failure to comply with the protein intake can harm the body.",
  "protein_text_5": "1. Meat\n\n2. Fish\n\n3. Curd\n\n4 Eggs\n\n5. Dairy products\n\n6. Legumes\n\n7. Soy",
  "fats_text_1": "Fats are organic matter, concentrated sources of calories. They contain twice as much energy as carbohydrates and proteins. Fat enhances the taste of the food and makes it more nutritious, but does not give the feeling of satiety.\n\nFats, like carbohydrates, are divided into two types: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated foods include foods that increase cholesterol levels: animal products, baked goods, etc. Unsaturated fats, you guessed it, lower cholesterol levels. These include plant foods and oils.",
  "fats_text_2": "Fats help to avoid vitamin deficiency, support the functioning of the nervous and endocrine systems, and improve cow circulation. In addition, without fatty acids in the diet, it is difficult to maintain healthy skin and hair.",
  "fats_text_3": "1. Growth and physical development will slow down\n\n2. Water exchange will be disturbed\n\n3. The level of cholesterol in the blood will rise\n\n4. The exchange of vitamins A and E will be disturbed\n\n5. The effect of the action of vitamins C and group B will decrease\n\n6. Dry skin and mucous membranes will appear\n\n7. Skin peeling and eczema will appear.\n\n8. There will be increased bleeding",
  "fats_text_4": "Fats are an integral part of all our cells. They stimulate brain activity, saturate the body with nutrients and maintain the state of the body as a whole. Without them, we would have aged long ago, and our skin would resemble sandpaper.",
  "fats_text_5": "1. Butter and milk fats\n\n2. Meat, lard, animal fats\n\n3. Palm oil\n\n4. Coconut oil\n\n5. Cocoa butter",

  "carbohydrates_text_1": "Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in the human body. They provide more than half of the total energy requirement and should make up approximately 50% of the diet.\n\nCarbohydrates are divided into \"simple\" and \"complex\". Simple carbohydrates include fructose and glucose (monosaccharides and disaccharides). Simple carbohydrates are instantly absorbed, while complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) undergo a long breakdown process. It is believed that a complex carbohydrate is healthier than a simple one.",
  "carbohydrates_text_2": "The main function of carbohydrates is energy. This is important for everyone who plays sports or looks after themselves. Carbohydrates are fuel for the body, therefore it is not recommended to reduce their consumption below the norm.",
  "carbohydrates_text_3": "1. Regular headaches\n\n2. Constant fatigue and drowsiness\n\n3. Indigestion\n\n4. Mood swings\n\n5. Profuse sweating\n\n6. Trembling in the body",
  "carbohydrates_text_4": "Although there is an opinion that the fewer carbohydrates, the better for the figure, you should not give up carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are a source of energy. Without it, you run the risk of severe harm to your body.",
